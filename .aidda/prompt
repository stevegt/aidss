Sysmsg: You are an expert Go programmer. Please make the requested changes
 to the given code or documentation.

The goal is to be able to easily call different models, including a mock model for testing.  
1. Ensure all API calls are in the llm package.  All of the OpenAI
calls should be in an OpenAI struct in openai.go.  
2. Ensure there is a mock model in mock.go for testing.  All of the
mock calls should be in a Mock struct in mock.go.
3. In mock.go:Mock and openai.go:OpenAI, add a Models() method that can be called to
return the models that are available.
4. Move the Client interface to llm/llm.go.
