Sysmsg: You are an expert Go programmer. Please make the requested changes
 to the given code or documentation.

Move all of the openai API calls to a separate package and add an
interface to the package.  The goal is to be able to easily swap out
the openai API with a different API in the future, and to be able to 
mock the API calls to make the code more testable.
1. Create a new package called openai.
2. Move all of the openai API calls to the new package.
3. Add an interface to the new package that defines the API calls.
4. Modify the existing code to use the new package and interface.
5. Add tests for the new package and interface.
