After we have generated the full prompt message, we should save it in a
file in the watchPath tree.  The file should be named
"prompt-full.txt".  This is the file that should be read when we
later collect messages recursively to build a query.

A goal is to keep messages in the watchPath tree but working files
elsewhere.  For example, if the base of a git repo is ~/lab/foo, and
the watchpath is ~/lab/foo/.aidss, then the message might be in
~/lab/foo/.aidss/round1/round2/, and an attached file might be in
~/lab/foo/doc/ideas.txt.

- Attached file paths should be relative to the parent of the watchPath.

A goal is to allow the user to specify files to be attached to the
prompt message.  

- The prompt file should be formatted similar to an rfc822 message
- In and Out headers might contain one or more filenames on the same
  line, and/or on continuation lines that are indented.  Filenames are
  space-delimited.
- Sysmsg header might contain multiple lines of text, indented.
- <OUT> tags might be nested, so we can't use a regular expression to
  parse them.  We need to use an XML parser.
- we should parse looking for each file in the outfiles list and warn
  if a file is not found in the XML.

Prompt text here.

A goal is to allow the LLM to provide updated files to the user.  The
user should be able to specify the files to be updated in the prompt
message by listing them in the "Out:" section.  The LLM should be able
to provide updated files in the response message.  The LLM should
delimit the files with unique XML tags.  For example, the LLM might
provide updated files as follows:
```
<OUT filename="cmd/aidss/main.go">
package main
 [...]
</OUT>

<OUT filename="cmd/aidss/main_test.go">
package main
 [...]
</OUT>
```
