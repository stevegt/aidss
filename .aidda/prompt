The goal is to be able to easily call different models, including a mock model for testing.  
- do we really need a Models() method in Client interface?
- move init() content to main()
- maxTokens should be an attribute of a Model struct
- possible that calls should be made to Model methods instead of Client methods
- do not mock inside the OpenAI struct's methods -- that's the job of
  the Mock struct methods
- have each provider read API key from environment variable (don't do
  it in main())
- set up client based on the model name
- remove MockLLMClient from main_test.go; use the mock model instead
