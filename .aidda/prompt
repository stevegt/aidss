The goal is to be able to easily call different models, including a mock model for testing.  
- get API key from env in provider constructor
- provider constructor returns nil if API key is not set
- ensure all test cases that need an LLM client use a mock-model client
  (instead of creating a mock function in the test case)
- do not mock inside openai.go that's the job of mock.go
