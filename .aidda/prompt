Sysmsg: You are an expert Go programmer. Please make the requested changes
 to the given code or documentation.

The goal is to be able to easily call different models, including a mock model for testing.  
- in openai.go, use the openai Go library instead of the mock and
  placeholder code 
- do not mock inside openai.go that's the job of mock.go
